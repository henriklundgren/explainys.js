DONE! #1 Find a better way of dealing with ifelse statement.

DONE! #2 Ifelse statement for title. If title attribute show, else show content of span.

REJECTED! #3 If no data-text given append Wikipedia information. See http://pmtarantino.github.com/wikiUp/ for info.
Is this smart? Why would I want to do this?

DONE! #4 Truncate text/div. Solved with HTML5 details element.

#5 Better class name for div.

DONE! #6 Style the reference number in DIV.

RELATED TO COLLISION DETECTION - #7 Mediaqueries and stuff.

DONE! #8 Add option to have details open by default.

#9 Deal with the effects of having an option to have details open by default.

DONE! #10 CSS fixes to deal with long titles.

#11 Change setting details open from $attr to $prop.

#12 Click to have details block open when hovering them, if setting closed.

#13 Move the .next object(details element) away from expanded. My thought is to have jQuery get the position()
of the current(hovered) and next, plus the current height() of current. Together it should suffice to have
a solution.

POSTPONED! #14 Animate the background color on span elements. Though jQuery does not support that. And i am reluctant
to work around it on my own. Hence the only real solution is to wait for jQuery team to come through.
Or can the solution be to use what is called css hooks? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.cssHooks/

DONE! #15 The title is set with attribute title (or actual word inside span element).
Change this behaviour to data-title instead since it better reflects the use case.

#16 Add a nice frowny pixel img when no sidenote written. Maybe base64 it?

DUPLICATE OF #13 - #17 Collision detection for collapsed and expanded detail elements. Maybe jQuery UI position?

#18 Clean up code related to detail block option open/closed

#19 Consider putting the detail elements in a ordered list. It does fit the purpose.

#20 Investigate viewport awareness instead of collision detection. See http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/viewport
