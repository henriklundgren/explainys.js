DONE! #1 Find a better way of dealing with ifelse statement.

DONE! #2 Ifelse statement for title. If title attribute show, else show content of span.

#3 If no data-text given append Wikipedia information. See http://pmtarantino.github.com/wikiUp/ for info.
Is this smart? Why would I want to do this?

DONE! #4 Truncate text/div. Solved with HTML5 details element.

#5 Better class name for div.

DONE! #6 Style the reference number in DIV.

#7 Mediaqueries and stuff.

DONE! #8 Add option to have details open by default.

#9 Deal with the effects of having an option to have details open by default.

#10 CSS fixes to deal with long titles.

#11 Change setting details open from $attr to $prop.

#12 Click to have details block open when hovering them

#13 Move the .next object(details element) away from expanded. My thought is to have jQuery get the position()
of the current(hovered) and next, plus the current height() of current. Together it should suffice to have
a solution.

#14 Animate the background color on span elements. Though jQuery does not support that. And i am reluctant
to work around it on my own. Hence the only real solution is to wait for jQuery team to come through.
Or can the solution be to use what is called css hooks? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.cssHooks/
